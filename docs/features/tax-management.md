# Tax Management Feature

## Overview
The Tax Management feature provides users with tools to estimate and track their tax obligations. It calculates estimated taxes based on net profit and allows users to record tax payments for comprehensive tax planning.

## Key Components

### 1. Tax Plans (`TaxPlan`)
**Purpose**: Represents tax planning periods with estimated tax rates and due dates.

**Key Properties**:
- `id`: Auto-incrementing unique identifier
- `periodKey`: Period identifier (e.g., "2025-01" for month or "2025-Q1" for quarter)
- `estimatedRate`: Tax rate as decimal (0.0 to 1.0, e.g., 0.15 for 15%)
- `dueDate`: Optional due date for tax payment
- `userId`: User isolation for multi-user support

**Important Implementation Details**:
- Flexible period tracking (monthly or quarterly)
- Decimal-based tax rate storage for precision
- Optional due date tracking for payment planning
- User-specific tax plans for data isolation

### 2. Tax Payments (`TaxPayment`)
**Purpose**: Records actual tax payments made by the user.

**Key Properties**:
- `id`: Auto-incrementing unique identifier
- `date`: Payment date (stored as DateTime)
- `amountMinor`: Payment amount in minor currency units (cents)
- `method`: Optional payment method (e.g., "Bank Transfer", "Check")
- `note`: Optional additional notes
- `userId`: User isolation

**Important Implementation Details**:
- Amount stored in minor units to avoid floating-point precision issues
- Payment method tracking for record keeping

## Backend Architecture

### Repository Pattern (`TaxRepository`)
**Purpose**: Handles all data operations for tax-related entities.

**Key Methods**:
- `upsertPlan(plan)`: Creates or updates tax plans
- `getPlans(userId)`: Retrieves user's tax plans
- `deletePlan(id)`: Removes tax plans
- `addPayment(payment)`: Creates new tax payment records
- `getPayments(userId)`: Retrieves user's tax payments
- `deletePayment(id)`: Removes tax payment records

**Important Implementation Details**:
- Uses Isar database with optimized queries
- User isolation for multi-user support
- Atomic operations for data consistency
- Efficient storage and retrieval of tax data

### State Management (`TaxCubit`)
**Purpose**: Manages application state for tax-related UI components.

**Key Methods**:
- `load(userId)`: Loads tax plans and payments into state
- `upsertPlan(plan)`: Manages tax plan CRUD operations
- `deletePlan(id)`: Handles tax plan deletion
- `addPayment(payment)`: Handles tax payment creation
- `deletePayment(id)`: Handles tax payment deletion

**Important Implementation Details**:
- Uses BLoC pattern for predictable state management
- Combined loading of plans and payments
- Loading states for UI feedback
- Automatic state updates after data operations

## User Interface

### Taxes Screen (`TaxesScreen`)
**Purpose**: Main interface for tax management and estimation.

**Key Features**:
- Tax rate configuration (default 15%)
- Monthly tax summary with calculations
- Tax payment recording
- Payment history display

## Tax Calculations

### Monthly Tax Estimation
```
Estimated Tax = Net Profit Ã— Tax Rate
Net Profit = Total Income - Total Expenses
```

5. **After-Tax Profit**: Net profit minus estimated tax

## Data Flow

1. **Tax Rate Setup**: User configures their tax rate (default 15%)
2. **Income/Expense Integration**: System pulls monthly income and expense data
3. **Tax Calculation**: Automatic calculation of estimated tax based on net profit
4. **Payment Recording**: User records actual tax payments made
5. **Historical Tracking**: Payment history maintained for tax planning

## Performance Optimizations

- **Real-time Calculations**: Immediate tax calculations without database queries
